 Mods I made for SMT 3 Nocturne HD Remaster

This repo contains every code mod I made, plus some documentation if I feel like it.
I'm just including .cs files, as my setup is kinda messy.
To use config presets you have to either replace and rename the file or copy the contents.

Currently this contains Puzzle Boy Maniax v1.0.0.
